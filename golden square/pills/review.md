# Feedback and review

There are two main ways you can request feedback on the Makers immersive
programme.

1. **The biweekly immersive portfolio review.**  
   Some tasks in the modules you do will ask you to submit your work to a form,
   often as a recording. This forms your immersive portfolio. The coaching team
   review your immersive portfolio roughly every two weeks and give you feedback
   on your progress as a whole.

2. **Ad-hoc feedback.**  
   If there's some work you'd specifically like feedback on, you can bring it to
   a coach in coaching hours and ask them for their feedback. Do make sure you
   mention that you'd like general feedback, otherwise they might think you're
   asking about a specific problem you're struggling with (or, if you are,
   mention that!)

If, at any point, you'd like feedback on your work, please drop in to the
coaches room on Zoom during coaching hours. They will be glad to provide it.

Otherwise, you will have feedback on your progress as a whole roughly once every
two weeks. You don't need to do anything special to get this.
