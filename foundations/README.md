# Ruby Foundations

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/foundations/ruby/DESIGN.x.md)_

## Learning objectives

In this section, you'll learn how to write programs using Ruby which will, necessarily, involve learning Ruby's syntax. Along the way, you'll also learn about [problem decomposition](./pills/problem_decomposition.md), [debugging](./pills/debugging.md), [peer code review](./PEER_REVIEW.md) and [experimenting in IRB](./pills/irb.md).

#### By the end of the module, you will be able to

- Execute Ruby code in two different ways
- Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
- Describe and use variables
- Describe and use conditionals
- Describe and use arrays
- Describe and use hashes
- Describe and use methods
- Describe and use classes
- Build programs using all of the above!

## Structure

There are 3 chapters to work through. The first chapter introduces a range of new concepts and which are built upon, and added to, as you progress through the other chapters. This process of introducing something and then revisiting it later on is called _spiralling_.

As you progress you'll be given challenges at several points, which you must complete before moving on. There are two types of challenge - _drills_ and _programs_.

> The three chapters are broken up into sections, each of which has both text and video versions.

### Progress Tracking

To help your coach provide the right support, at the right time, please **log your progress at the end of each section using the form provided at that point**. It should only take a few seconds.

### Drills

These challenges are really tightly focused and repetitive. The goal is to become familiar with the basic building blocks of programming.

> You'll be asked to zip up and share your solutions to these exercises so that your coach can see what you're learning and what you need to focus on next.

### Programs

These challenges require you to bring those basic building blocks together and build a useful program.

> You'll be asked to do a screen recording when working on this challenge so that your coaches can see what you're learning and what you need to focus on next.

### Peer Code Review

Upon submission of your various programming tasks in this module, your technical coach will pair you up with someone who will review your code. Work with this colleague, until you are both happy that the submission is adequate at which point you can merge the branch and close the Pull Request.

You can navigate [here](./PEER_REVIEW.md) to view the Peer Review Overview.
