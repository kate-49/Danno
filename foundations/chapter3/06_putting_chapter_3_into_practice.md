# Putting it Into Practice

In this section, you'll put everything from chapter 3 into practice by working on a series of challenges.

Please go [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby_challenges/tree/main/ruby_chapter_3_challenges) to get started and then come back to reflect on your progress before moving on to section 7. (That link is to chapter 3 of the challenges repo you previously cloned).

## Reflect and Review

Well done for completing the Chapter 3 challenges!

**Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...**

- What did you find hard about the drills?
- What did you find hard about the programming challenge?
- What one thing would you like to learn more about?
