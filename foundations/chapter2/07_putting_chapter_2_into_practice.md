# Putting it Into Practice

In this section, you'll put everything from chapter 2 into practice by working on a series of challenges.

Go [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby_challenges/tree/main/ruby_chapter_2_challenges) to get started. (That link is to chapter 2 in the challenges repo that you previously cloned).

## Reflect and Review

Well done for completing the chapter 2 challenges!

**Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...**

- What did you find hard about the drills?
- What did you find hard about the programming challenge?
- What one thing would you like to learn more about?
